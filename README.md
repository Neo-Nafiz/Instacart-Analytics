> **Note:** To download the Instacart Market Basket Analysis dataset from Kaggle, use the following command:
> 
> ```bash
> kaggle competitions download -c instacart-market-basket-analysis
> ```

**Excel:** files in .csv format were used to store the downloaded data.

**SQL:** the data in the Excel files were too large to manipulate on the file, and would lose contents if I tried saving it, so they were uploaded to a SQL database using PostgreSQL. 

**Jupyter:** Notebooks were utilized to manipulate the data due to their versatile application and capabilities.

**Python:** Code to extract and data from SQL database and employ mathematical calculations to visualize meaningful data.
